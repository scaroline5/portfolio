# Jenkins

It contains a dockerfile used to build a custom Jenkins image. 

Upon building a container using this image, the Setup Wizard will be bypassed. The **plugins.txt** contains the list of plugins that will be automatically installed. 

The **config-as-code.yml** is the configuration file used by **Configuration as Code** plugin. In this file you can setup the jenkins URL, the Admin user, and user permissions.
